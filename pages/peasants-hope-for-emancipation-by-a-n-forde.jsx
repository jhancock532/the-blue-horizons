          Mercury lightens
          <br />
          my veins to see
          <br />
          the field burning:
          <br />
          a fountain splashes
          <br />
          the walls of my heart.
          <br />
          <br />
          Sap rises hectic
          <br />
          up my stalk of pride
          <br />
          and shoots vision
          <br />
          like a green leaf
          <br />
          over my budding eyes.
          <br />
          <br />
          My heart is a redness
          <br />
          like the red panic
          <br />
          of the cane and the wind
          <br />
          intoxicated
          <br />
          tossing confetti in the air.
          <br />
          <br />
          Die not great flare
          <br />
          be a symptom
          <br />
          of our rise that we
          <br />
          take to the sky
          <br />
          like the bird or the proud wave.
          <br />
          <br />
          Soon will be no cloud
          <br />
          on the conscience of
          <br />
          the morning sky
          <br />
          no red
          <br />
          to spill the evening breath.
          <br />
          <br />
          But lavender
          <br />
          lying on the lips
          <br />
          and song sitting
          <br />
          on the strings of the heart.
          <br />
