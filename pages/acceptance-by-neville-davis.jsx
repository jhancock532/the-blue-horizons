        <p>by NEVILLE DAWES</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I praise the glorious summers of pimento
          <br />
          Sun-purple, riper than the wet red clay-smell
          <br />
          Of my youth by cornlight and river-run
          <br />
          As dog and I, we screamed the small green hill
          <br />
          And the salt smooth wind from the leaping sea
          <br />
          Sang in the yellow sunflower.
          <br />
          <br />
          I praise the dumb scared child made me
          <br />
          In coffee-groves, and the barbecues of graves.
          <br />
          Smelling of ghosts' old country flesh, laid
          <br />
          By my father for his tribe (fictitious as angels);
          <br />
          A small all-alone boy riding to harvest hymns
          <br />
          In the green of the day as the shackle-bell tongued
          <br />
          On the churchy hill-top.
          <br />
          <br />
          I praise the legends we made
          <br />
          When the drunk hawks and worse were merry
          <br />
          Waltzed up the day
          <br />
          Halloed the mountains of birds and the nestling curve of the reeling
          river
          <br />
          <br />
          Swam, those eyes reading the first garden's blush and Adam's.
          <br />
          When weathers twisted the old thunder-voice
          <br />
          I was King Arthur's irrelevant steed on the lightning page
          <br />
          <br />
          Castling
          <br />
          All races, all men, the drunk hawks and worse
          <br />
          Climbing together the top of the colourless rain
          <br />
          To the dappling sun.
          <br />
          <br />
          I praise all this
          <br />
          Returning in a shower of mango-blossoms-
          <br />
          The creaking village, the old eyes, the graves, the sun's kiss-
          <br />
          <br />
          And lonely as ever, as the bare cedars,
          <br />
          I walk by the stream (where boys still plash
          <br />
          Dusking and falling in a star-apple sunset)
          <br />
          And find her there, ancient as the lost lands,
          <br />
          Bandannaed and gray and calling:
          <br />
          Then I read the monumental legend of her love
          <br />
          And grasp her wrinkled hands.
          <br />
