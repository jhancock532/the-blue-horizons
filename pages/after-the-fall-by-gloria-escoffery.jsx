        <h1>After the Fall</h1>
        <p>by GLORIA ESCOFFERY</p>

        <p>
          Often you have watched the rain fall
          <br />
          And have become the rain drops.
          <br />
          The passion in the thunder shower is yours
          <br />
          And the slow, grey death of drizzle.
          <br />
          <br />
          You have heard rain for days unceasing, and have taken
          <br />
          To yourself the blind anguish of dripping leaves.
          <br />
          Yours is the dirge of sky weeping, like Rachel, for her children.
          <br />
          <br />
          Yours the children,
          <br />
          The death,
          <br />
          The rebirth of sunshine on wet grass.
          <br />
          Today you have seen a waterfall and have been
          <br />
          A young thing rushing headlong, to destruction.
          <br />
