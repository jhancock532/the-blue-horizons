          Splitting from Jack Delaney's, Sheridan Square,
          <br />
          that winter night, stewed, seasoned in bourbon,
          <br />
          my body kindled by the whistling air
          <br />
          snowing the Village that Christ was reborn,
          <br />
          I lurched like any lush by his own glow
          <br />
          across towards Sixth, and froze before the tracks
          <br />
          of footprints bleeding on the virgin snow.
          <br />
          <br />
          I tracked them where they led across the street
          <br />
          to the bright side, entering the wax-
          <br />
          sealed smell of neon, human heat,
          <br />
          some all-night diner with its wise-guy cook
          <br />
          his stub thumb in my bowl of stew and one
          <br />
          man's pulped and beaten face, its look
          <br />
          acknowledging all that, white-dark outside,
          <br />
          was possible: some beast prowling the block,
          <br />
          something fur-clotted, running wild
          <br />
          beyond the boundary of will. Outside,
          <br />
          more snow had fallen. My heart charred.
          <br />
          I longed for darkness, evil that was warm.
          <br />
          Walking, I'd stop and turn. What had I heard,
          <br />
          wheezing behind my heel with whitening breath?
          <br />
          Mothing. Sixth Avenue yawned wet and wide.
          <br />
          The night was white. There was nowhere to hide.
