          How lovely the Croton leaves!
          <br />
          Such life clusters, yellow and green,
          <br />
          Mottled and matched to no man's whim,
          <br />
          Mock our sick passions. Nor you, nor I
          <br />
          Can tarnish their splendour.
          <br />
          My death from this high window,
          <br />
          Brief as the blinking of an eye,
          <br />
          Passes. I would rise with the leaves
          <br />
          And be away out of this narrow courtyard.
