          <br />
          As I walked with my friend,
          <br />
          My singular Columbus,
          <br />
          Where the land comes to an end
          <br />
          And the path is perilous,
          <br />
          Where the wheel and tattered shoe
          <br />
          And bottle have been thrown,
          <br />
          And the sky is shining blue,
          <br />
          And the heart sinks like a stone,
          <br />
          <br />
          I plucked his sleeve and said,
          <br />
          'I have come far to find
          <br />
          The springs of a broken bed,
          <br />
          The ocean, and the wind,
          <br />
          I'd rather live in Greece,
          <br />
          Castile, or an English town
          <br />
          Than wander here like this
          <br />
          Where the dunes come tumbling down.'
          <br />
          <br />
          He answered me, 'Perhaps.
          <br />
          But Europe never guessed
          <br />
          America, their maps
          <br />
          Could not describe the West.
          <br />
          And though in Plato's glass
          <br />
          The stars were still and clear,
          <br />
          Yet nothing came to pass
          <br />
          And men died of despair.'
          <br />
          <br />
          He said, 'If there is not
          <br />
          A way to China, one
          <br />
          City surpassing thought,
          <br />
          My ghost will still go on.
          <br />
          I'll spread the airy sail,'
          <br />
          He said, 'and point the sprit
          <br />
          To a county that cannot fail,
          <br />
          For there's no finding it.'
          <br />
          <br />
          Straightway we separated—
          <br />
          He, in his fading coat,
          <br />
          To the water's edge, where waited
          <br />
          An admiral's longboat.
          <br />
          A crew of able seamen
          <br />
          Sprang up at his command—
          <br />
          An angle or a demon—
          <br />
          And they rowed him from the land.
