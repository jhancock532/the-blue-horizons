          His shoes, which you can't see, the little peasant's
          <br />
          Are huge with earth, and damp with season's rain.
          <br />
          He does not know of any world beyond his:
          <br />
          Soil, seeding, fruiting, and the soil again.
          <br />
          <br />
          But in his eyes a certain shrewd assessment
          <br />
          Of weathers' change, and freckled starlight, glows.
          <br />
          His hands, at rest, have given massive blessing
          <br />
          To root and wildflower, cabbage leaf and rose.
          <br />
          <br />
          It is quite strange to him to have to sit so;
          <br />
          Nor turn his head to watch a cart go by.
          <br />
          But he accepts the moment as it passesâ€”
          <br />
          And does not dream that it will never die.
