          To the Memory
          <br />
          of
          <br />
          WILLIAM ARTHUR RICHARDSON
          <br />
          and
          <br />
          JOHN GRENFELL WILLIAMS
          <br />
          one a Trinidadian
          <br />
          the other a South African
          <br />
          <br />
          both because of conditions at home
          <br />
          working for long spells abroad
          <br />
          both (in the shared concern for
          <br />
          writing and broadcasting)
          <br />
          generous and helpful
          <br />
          to West Indian writers
          <br />
          <br />
          both remembered gratefully and with affection,
          <br />
          through this book
          <br />
          many poems of which
          <br />
          would not have reached a wider audience
          <br />
          without their original concern and encouragement.
          <br />
          <br />
          Peace to them, and Love.
