          Look at me, I am Ishmael,
          <br />
          Ham's heir, the spit and spawn of Cain
          <br />
          The outcast with the twisted brain.
          <br />
          Lord of Cats Castle, fit for Hell.
          <br />
          <br />
          I got no chance. The social odds
          <br />
          Were dead against me when they sent
          <br />
          Me up The Hill because I went
          <br />
          For some forgotten prank to Dodds.
          <br />
          <br />
          And so because they made me wince,
          <br />
          And stretched me on the legal rack,
          <br />
          I took an oath I would hit back,
          <br />
          And have been hitting ever since.
          <br />
          <br />
          Maybe it is a foolish game
          <br />
          Judged by the record. Who likes jail?
          <br />
          But then I've fought them tooth and nail,
          <br />
          And surely that's no cause for shame.
          <br />
          <br />
          Reform, you say? Reform indeed!
          <br />
          Let's all reform. They must not quit
          <br />
          The Golden Rule, and I from it
          <br />
          Will not stray once. That is our need.
