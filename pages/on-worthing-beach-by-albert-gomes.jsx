        <h1>On Worthing beach</h1>
        <p>by ALBERT GOMES</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I heard the wild laughter
          <br />
          Of the brown women with their ivory smiles
          <br />
          Echoing above the surf and over the green water
          <br />
          At dawn in beautiful Barbados.
          <br />
          <br />
          And I thought the laughter
          <br />
          A snarl of triumph hurled in the faces
          <br />
          Of the successful bankers, the atomic scientists
          <br />
          By the proud profiteers of the sun.
          <br />
          <br />
          And I thought the poets
          <br />
          Who daily rehearse an impossible death
          <br />
          Of the living which the dead know not
          <br />
          May well envy these gazelles
          <br />
          <br />
          And all long exiled
          <br />
          From the confident suns and poised moments
          <br />
          And animal virtue of their childhood,
          <br />
          Should honour, not deride, this laughter.
          <br />
          <br />
          For cold is the comfort
          <br />
          Of knowing and thrilless the heroics
          <br />
          Of the act of forced obedience that is informed
          <br />
          By a defiance that is helpless.
          <br />
          <br />
          I think this laughter is
          <br />
          The proud ensign of the green, lush country
          <br />
          Somewhere in the centre of past and future-
          <br />
          A no trespass sign for Time.
          <br />
          <br />
          These eternal natives
          <br />
          In the fields of blind, imperilled moments
          <br />
          Have grown the graceful palms of swift compliance
          <br />
          For the remorseless winds.
          <br />
          <br />
          For this is the country
          <br />
          Where the primal gifts are lovingly hoarded.
          <br />
          A child hurls the invective of hope against
          <br />
          Circumambient cares,
          <br />
          <br />
          These natives have preserved
          <br />
          Their uncurtained days against the vandal Time.
          <br />
          Ceaseless the surf, endless the swoon of white beach
          <br />
          And proud their nakedness,
          <br />
          <br />
          But we seek forever
          <br />
          To stretch greed beyond the stated ration
          <br />
          From the future, guarantees, from the past, excuses
          <br />
          Beyond the reach of man.
