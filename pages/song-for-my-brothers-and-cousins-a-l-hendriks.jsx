        <h1>Song for my brothers and cousins</h1>
        <p>by A. L. HENDRIKS</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          O what the heart has loved cannot be torn away!
          <br />
          The separate path, the lonely road is anguish, o my brothers,
          <br />
          for we are still in love, no matter what we say.
          <br />
          <br />
          Lovers will hear no voice that tries to drive their love away
          <br />
          and what the heart once knows and loves, forever holds its sway:
          <br />
          our gentle cousins call us still in accents soft, my brothers,
          <br />
          for they are still in love, no matter what we say!
          <br />
          <br />
          Islands of the south have much to share with us,
          <br />
          and much to give, and giving they are gay;
          <br />
          are we too poor to share our gifts with others?
          <br />
          are we so weak, so vain, so proud, my brothers?
          <br />
          and can the heart forget its promises, all in a single day?
          <br />
          <br />
          The songs we sing will now lament this agonized delay,
          <br />
          but we are still in love, my brothers, no matter what we say,
          <br />
          and what the heart has loved, my brothers, cannot be torn away.
