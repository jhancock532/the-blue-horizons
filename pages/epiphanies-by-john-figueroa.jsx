          <em>
            From the 'Tower' Class Room at St. George's College, Jamaica, during
            target practice from shore to sea
          </em>
          <br />
          <br />
          I have lifted my eyes above their heads
          <br />
          And looked across the green protecting arm
          <br />
          That dams and breaks atlantic dreads;
          <br />
          From class-room tower and our babel to calm
          <br />
          Of inner sea unruffled by the slightest foam,
          <br />
          To open sea's roughcast and blue-white charm.
          <br />
          <br />
          The heard and unseen arc of the shell strikes home
          <br />
          The Moses staff causing from the sea to sprout
          <br />
          A court-yard fountain, if heaven be the dome
          <br />
          Of blue upon the salt blue drought
          <br />
          Of desert ocean that needed this white rose,
          <br />
          This cluster white of bamboo shoots that out
          <br />
          Of blue rock at the strike of Moses grows
          <br />
          And pauses at the balance point that makes
          <br />
          The shape, that holds the pattern's close.
          <br />
          <br />
          The bamboo plumes outward, white and takes
          <br />
          Its shape forever rooted in this sleeping sea
          <br />
          The hurrying motion of innumerable flakes
          <br />
          Of white and blue from ocean's rock I see
          <br />
          As motionless and full, unhurried calm,
          <br />
          As balanced as permanent as a perfect tree.
          <br />
          <br />
          I look back at their faces' slight alarm
          <br />
          And wide-eyed wonder at my wandering-
          <br />
          These children's balanced being to be the palm
          <br />
          That bends to every wind's imposturing!
          <br />
          Each searching eye is a murky pool
          <br />
          Slowly lighted by shafts of quivering
          <br />
          Laughter. We turn the pages and make the best of school.

        <p>
          <em>At Cette, from the cemetery where Paul Valery is buried</em>
          <br />
          <br />
          I stand upon a Mediterranean slope
          <br />
          And look beyond white grave-stones to the tight
          <br />
          Stretching of green water, a silken rope
          <br />
          Played from the central deep to the edges white;
          <br />
          Aside in sandals I see the striding flesh
          <br />
          As through a yew tree breaks the light
          <br />
          <br />
          Of lovers in their summer white above the mesh
          <br />
          Of grass and sand and clay that will sift them yet
          <br />
          To their dead brothers whom no winds refresh
          <br />
          For whom the rush and dash of waves beget
          <br />
          No dreams, no green urges yearning towards the sea.
          <br />
          <br />
          The heard and unseen words of Valery set
          <br />
          Off the fountain from his tomb, and we
          <br />
          Become the balanced fountain; the hurrying
          <br />
          Constellations of our blood, the plea
          <br />
          <br />
          Of every urge is caught; the scurrying
          <br />
          Is at the balance point; each fountain drop
          <br />
          Is held in place; our inner worrying
          <br />
          Moves no more and yet we grow, and stop
          <br />
          Caught in the crystal pattern's close
          <br />
          In the tree, in Valery's voiced fountain top,
          <br />
          <br />
          In bamboo-shoots and sea's drought-quenching rose.

        <p>III.</p>
        <p>
          <em>
            On his Grandmother's Death, news of which he received in
            Lans-en-Vercours
          </em>
          <br />
          <br />
          Amidst this blue of skies and white of snows
          <br />
          I read the note from occidental hills
          <br />
          From where the slug-trailed custard-apple grows
          <br />
          And the bastard bombay mango daily fills
          <br />
          Its olive skin with juices that attain
          <br />
          The cycle's point of closure where fullness kills,
          <br />
          From where her trees so blindly know the gain
          <br />
          That sunlight brings, that soil provides, I hear
          <br />
          That she is dead.
          <br />
          <br />
          Vibration of tolling bell again.
          <br />
          I feel, first felt with her at funeral
          <br />
          Of Bishop O'Hare, the sapling I beneath her shade
          <br />
          Not dreaming yet that time that made me tall
          <br />
          Would bend her to the earth and with its spade
          <br />
          <br />
          Plough her ashes back to bless the soil
          <br />
          While her spirit's crystal fountain played
          <br />
          Above the roughcast ocean, above the toil
          <br />
          Of lovers young who stride on grass that covers
          <br />
          The bones and melted breasts where coil
          <br />
          Fingers and worms of their dead brothers.
          <br />
          <br />
          The dead sea fountain sings to me with still
          <br />
          Persisting shape, Valery's perpetual motion hovers
          <br />
          In his voiced words shaping the silence on a hill
          <br />
          Above the central sea;
          <br />
          <br />
          but you whose death
          <br />
          Disturbs these snows, scorching cold eyes that fill
          <br />
          The soul with wonder and with salt, even without breath
          <br />
          You live, not an impressed scent among yellow pages,
          <br />
          Not conjured back by any reader's breath,
          <br />
          <br />
          But fountain of your being plays against the rages
          <br />
          Of time's raucous sea, the rose you were and are
          <br />
          And ever will be is your self still bursting through the ages.
