        <h1>Letter for a friend</h1>

        <h2>I</h2>
        <p>
          It is not always dark
          <br />
          Often I have seen day with dawn
          <br />
          Like a rag dusting out the night
          <br />
          And the stars retreat into the deep sky;
          <br />
          Seen the houses come out of hiding
          <br />
          And the day awake, shake itself,
          <br />
          Resume its business.
          <br />
          <br />
          It is not always dark.
          <br />
          <br />
          This letter is emotions overdue
          <br />
          But I must let you know
          <br />
          That I call sorrow synonym
          <br />
          For joy confuse pain and pleasure
          <br />
          Nickname love necessity.
          <br />
          <br />
          So when uncertainties ago the season
          <br />
          Was fitful I prayed that He would
          <br />
          Jamaica us, and when fears ago we
          <br />
          Daemocles and Soulfriere hung a threat
          <br />
          He did not spill us as I had hoped
          <br />
          So that love could come like a thief
          <br />
          And circumstance chisel friendship out of ashes.
          <br />
        </p>
        <h2>II</h2>
        <p>
          So burn no holes in your cheek
          <br />
          With tears my friend
          <br />
          The dead are more secure than we
          <br />
          Past the spite in the sun and the farcical smile
          <br />
          <br />
          The habit of living and the dry jest in the
          <br />
          Cracking wind; for earthquakes do not shake
          <br />
          Them through the earth cracks
          <br />
          But we crack at each tumble of the sky.
          <br />
          <br />
          Resuscitation begins in the dark
          <br />
          And out of the night the light is begot;
          <br />
          Eternity is the stretch
          <br />
          And time is the boundary stone.
          <br />
          But on the edge of the heart
          <br />
          Wisdom is weak.
          <br />
          <br />
          And I too have paid my bill for sorrow
          <br />
          Cashed my share of tears
          <br />
          Known the currency of the salt cheek
          <br />
          And learnt that grief is no miser
          <br />
