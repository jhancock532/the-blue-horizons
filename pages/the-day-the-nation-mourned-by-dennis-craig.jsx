        <h1>The day the nation mourned</h1>
        <p>by DENNIS CRAIG</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          His life had shouted his name
          <br />
          from far, till we knew it even
          <br />
          in the backyard rubble where
          <br />
          wild daisies choked the grass
          <br />
          and made cushions on
          <br />
          old tin-cans and broken bottles.
          <br />
          His death was huge
          <br />
          like the earth he lived on.
          <br />
          Now his face, alive
          <br />
          only on an old newspaper
          <br />
          fascinates like any face
          <br />
          from which the breath has gone.
          <br />
          <br />
          The government declared it
          <br />
          a day of mourning. The radio
          <br />
          mentioned widow and child, then
          <br />
          played a requiem and funeral march.
          <br />
          But I knew they could not have liked
          <br />
          to hear those then. Bach and Chopin
          <br />
          made those to translate
          <br />
          the majesty of death: playing them
          <br />
          makes death worse: only folk
          <br />
          who are not grieved can take
          <br />
          sorrow with the sound of solemn music.
          <br />
          <br />
          So, after the first hour
          <br />
          the radio and we afar off
          <br />
          became spoilt children
          <br />
          forcing a cry and a tear
          <br />
          and time became an extra Sunday.
          <br />
          <br />
          Two thousand years should be enough
          <br />
          to end our feigning—not
          <br />
          that we should not care.
          <br />
          I came out under the sky and, thank God,
          <br />
          when I passed the corner, the skittles
          <br />
          had begun to clatter in Mac's joint,—with
          <br />
          one door open and the smell of beer.
          <br />
          And at the beach, cars were unloading
          <br />
          freight for a holiday: bare bodies
          <br />
          thirsting for sea and sun and air.
          <br />
          <br />
          His death was huge
          <br />
          like the earth we live on, but time
          <br />
          had become another Sunday—not
          <br />
          that we did not care.
