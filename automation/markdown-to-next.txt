# Dedication

To the Memory
of
WILLIAM ARTHUR RICHARDSON
and
JOHN GRENFELL WILLIAMS
one a Trinidadian
the other a South African

both because of conditions at home
working for long spells abroad
both (in the shared concern for
writing and broadcasting)
generous and helpful
to West Indian writers

both remembered gratefully and with affection,
through this book
many poems of which
would not have reached a wider audience
without their original concern and encouragement.

Peace to them, and Love.

<em>
To find the Western path,
Right thro' the Gates of Wrath...
  —Blake
</em>
  
As I walked with my friend,
My singular Columbus,
Where the land comes to an end
And the path is perilous,
Where the wheel and tattered shoe
And bottle have been thrown,
And the sky is shining blue,
And the heart sinks like a stone,

I plucked his sleeve and said,
'I have come far to find
The springs of a broken bed,
The ocean, and the wind,
I'd rather live in Greece,
Castile, or an English town
Than wander here like this
Where the dunes come tumbling down.'

He answered me, 'Perhaps.
But Europe never guessed
America, their maps
Could not describe the West.
And though in Plato's glass
The stars were still and clear,
Yet nothing came to pass
And men died of despair.'

He said, 'If there is not
A way to China, one
City surpassing thought,
My ghost will still go on.
I'll spread the airy sail,'
He said, 'and point the sprit
To a county that cannot fail,
For there's no finding it.'

Straightway we separated—
He, in his fading coat,
To the water's edge, where waited
An admiral's longboat.
A crew of able seamen
Sprang up at his command—
An angle or a demon—
And they rowed him from the land.
