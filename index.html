  <h2>Columbus</h2>

    <em>
    To find the Western path,
    Right thro' the Gates of Wrath...
      —Blake
    </em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As I walked with my friend,
    My singular Columbus,
    Where the land comes to an end
    And the path is perilous,
    Where the wheel and tattered shoe
    And bottle have been thrown,
    And the sky is shining blue,
    And the heart sinks like a stone,
    
    I plucked his sleeve and said,
    'I have come far to find
    The springs of a broken bed,
    The ocean, and the wind,
    I'd rather live in Greece,
    Castile, or an English town
    Than wander here like this
    Where the dunes come tumbling down.'
    
    He answered me, 'Perhaps.
    But Europe never guessed
    America, their maps
    Could not describe the West.
    And though in Plato's glass
    The stars were still and clear,
    Yet nothing came to pass
    And men died of despair.'
    
    He said, 'If there is not
    A way to China, one
    City surpassing thought,
    My ghost will still go on.
    I'll spread the airy sail,'
    He said, 'and point the sprit
    To a county that cannot fail,
    For there's no finding it.'
    
    Straightway we separated—
    He, in his fading coat,
    To the water's edge, where waited
    An admiral's longboat.
    A crew of able seamen
    Sprang up at his command—
    An angle or a demon—
    And they rowed him from the land.

  <h2 id="after-the-fall">After the Fall</h2>
  
  <p>
    Often you have watched the rain fall
    And have become the rain drops.
    The passion in the thunder shower is yours
    And the slow, grey death of drizzle.
    
    You have heard rain for days unceasing, and have taken
    To yourself the blind anguish of dripping leaves.
    Yours is the dirge of sky weeping, like Rachel, for her children.
    
    Yours the children,
    The death,
    The rebirth of sunshine on wet grass.
    Today you have seen a waterfall and have been
    A young thing rushing headlong, to destruction.
