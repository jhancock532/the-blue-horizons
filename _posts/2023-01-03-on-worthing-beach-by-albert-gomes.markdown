I heard the wild laughter
Of the brown women with their ivory smiles
Echoing above the surf and over the green water
At dawn in beautiful Barbados.

And I thought the laughter
A snarl of triumph hurled in the faces
Of the successful bankers, the atomic scientists
By the proud profiteers of the sun.

And I thought the poets
Who daily rehearse an impossible death
Of the living which the dead know not
May well envy these gazelles

And all long exiled
From the confident suns and poised moments
And animal virtue of their childhood,
Should honour, not deride, this laughter.

For cold is the comfort
Of knowing and thrilless the heroics
Of the act of forced obedience that is informed
By a defiance that is helpless.

I think this laughter is
The proud ensign of the green, lush country
Somewhere in the centre of past and future-
A no trespass sign for Time.

These eternal natives
In the fields of blind, imperilled moments
Have grown the graceful palms of swift compliance
For the remorseless winds.

For this is the country
Where the primal gifts are lovingly hoarded.
A child hurls the invective of hope against
Circumambient cares,

These natives have preserved
Their uncurtained days against the vandal Time.
Ceaseless the surf, endless the swoon of white beach
And proud their nakedness,

But we seek forever
To stretch greed beyond the stated ration
From the future, guarantees, from the past, excuses
Beyond the reach of man.
