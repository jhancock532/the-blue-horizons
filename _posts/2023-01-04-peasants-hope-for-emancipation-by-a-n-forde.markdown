Mercury lightens
my veins to see
the field burning:
a fountain splashes
the walls of my heart.

Sap rises hectic
up my stalk of pride
and shoots vision
like a green leaf
over my budding eyes.

My heart is a redness
like the red panic
of the cane and the wind
intoxicated
tossing confetti in the air.

Die not great flare
be a symptom
of our rise that we
take to the sky
like the bird or the proud wave.

Soon will be no cloud
on the conscience of
the morning sky
no red
to spill the evening breath.

But lavender
lying on the lips
and song sitting
on the strings of the heart.
