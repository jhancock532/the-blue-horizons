How lovely the Croton leaves!
Such life clusters, yellow and green,
Mottled and matched to no man's whim,
Mock our sick passions. Nor you, nor I
Can tarnish their splendour.
My death from this high window,
Brief as the blinking of an eye,
Passes. I would rise with the leaves
And be away out of this narrow courtyard.
