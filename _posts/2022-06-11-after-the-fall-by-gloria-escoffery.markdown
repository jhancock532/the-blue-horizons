# After the Fall

Often you have watched the rain fall
And have become the rain drops.
The passion in the thunder shower is yours
And the slow, grey death of drizzle.

You have heard rain for days unceasing, and have taken
To yourself the blind anguish of dripping leaves.
Yours is the dirge of sky weeping, like Rachel, for her children.

Yours the children,
The death,
The rebirth of sunshine on wet grass.
Today you have seen a waterfall and have been
A young thing rushing headlong, to destruction.
