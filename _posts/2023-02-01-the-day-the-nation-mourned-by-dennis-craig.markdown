His life had shouted his name
from far, till we knew it even
in the backyard rubble where
wild daisies choked the grass
and made cushions on
old tin-cans and broken bottles.
His death was huge
like the earth he lived on.
Now his face, alive
only on an old newspaper
fascinates like any face
from which the breath has gone.

The government declared it
a day of mourning. The radio
mentioned widow and child, then
played a requiem and funeral march.
But I knew they could not have liked
to hear those then. Bach and Chopin
made those to translate
the majesty of death: playing them
makes death worse: only folk
who are not grieved can take
sorrow with the sound of solemn music.

So, after the first hour
the radio and we afar off
became spoilt children
forcing a cry and a tear
and time became an extra Sunday.

Two thousand years should be enough
to end our feigning—not
that we should not care.
I came out under the sky and, thank God,
when I passed the corner, the skittles
had begun to clatter in Mac's joint,—with
one door open and the smell of beer.
And at the beach, cars were unloading
freight for a holiday: bare bodies
thirsting for sea and sun and air.

His death was huge
like the earth we live on, but time
had become another Sunday—not
that we did not care.
