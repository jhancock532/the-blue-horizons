I praise the glorious summers of pimento
Sun-purple, riper than the wet red clay-smell
Of my youth by cornlight and river-run
As dog and I, we screamed the small green hill
And the salt smooth wind from the leaping sea
Sang in the yellow sunflower.

I praise the dumb scared child made me
In coffee-groves, and the barbecues of graves.
Smelling of ghosts' old country flesh, laid
By my father for his tribe (fictitious as angels);
A small all-alone boy riding to harvest hymns
In the green of the day as the shackle-bell tongued
On the churchy hill-top.

I praise the legends we made
When the drunk hawks and worse were merry
Waltzed up the day
Halloed the mountains of birds and the nestling curve of the reeling river

Swam, those eyes reading the first garden's blush and Adam's.
When weathers twisted the old thunder-voice
I was King Arthur's irrelevant steed on the lightning page

Castling
All races, all men, the drunk hawks and worse
Climbing together the top of the colourless rain
To the dappling sun.

I praise all this
Returning in a shower of mango-blossoms-
The creaking village, the old eyes, the graves, the sun's kiss-

And lonely as ever, as the bare cedars,
I walk by the stream (where boys still plash
Dusking and falling in a star-apple sunset)
And find her there, ancient as the lost lands,
Bandannaed and gray and calling:
Then I read the monumental legend of her love
And grasp her wrinkled hands.
