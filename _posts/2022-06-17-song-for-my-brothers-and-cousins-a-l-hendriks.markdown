O what the heart has loved cannot be torn away!
The separate path, the lonely road is anguish, o my brothers,
for we are still in love, no matter what we say.

Lovers will hear no voice that tries to drive their love away
and what the heart once knows and loves, forever holds its sway:
our gentle cousins call us still in accents soft, my brothers,
for they are still in love, no matter what we say!

Islands of the south have much to share with us,
and much to give, and giving they are gay;
are we too poor to share our gifts with others?
are we so weak, so vain, so proud, my brothers?
and can the heart forget its promises, all in a single day?

The songs we sing will now lament this agonized delay,
but we are still in love, my brothers, no matter what we say,
and what the heart has loved, my brothers, cannot be torn away.
