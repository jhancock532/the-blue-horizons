### I

It is not always dark
Often I have seen day with dawn
Like a rag dusting out the night
And the stars retreat into the deep sky;
Seen the houses come out of hiding
And the day awake, shake itself,
Resume its business.

It is not always dark.

This letter is emotions overdue
But I must let you know
That I call sorrow synonym
For joy confuse pain and pleasure
Nickname love necessity.

So when uncertainties ago the season
Was fitful I prayed that He would
Jamaica us, and when fears ago we
Daemocles and Soulfriere hung a threat
He did not spill us as I had hoped
So that love could come like a thief
And circumstance chisel friendship out of ashes.

### II

So burn no holes in your cheek
With tears my friend
The dead are more secure than we
Past the spite in the sun and the farcical smile

The habit of living and the dry jest in the
Cracking wind; for earthquakes do not shake
Them through the earth cracks
But we crack at each tumble of the sky.

Resuscitation begins in the dark
And out of the night the light is begot;
Eternity is the stretch
And time is the boundary stone.
But on the edge of the heart
Wisdom is weak.

And I too have paid my bill for sorrow
Cashed my share of tears
Known the currency of the salt cheek
And learnt that grief is no miser
