His shoes, which you can't see, the little peasant's Are huge with earth, and damp with season's rain. He does not know of any world beyond his: Soil, seeding, fruiting, and the soil again.

But in his eyes a certain shrewd assessment Of weathers' change, and freckled starlight, glows. His hands, at rest, have given massive blessing To root and wildflower, cabbage leaf and rose.

It is quite strange to him to have to sit so; Nor turn his head to watch a cart go by. But he accepts the moment as it passesâ€” And does not dream that it will never die.
