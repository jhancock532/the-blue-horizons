I.

<em>From the 'Tower' Class Room at St. George's College,
Jamaica, during target practice from shore to sea</em>

I have lifted my eyes above their heads
And looked across the green protecting arm
That dams and breaks atlantic dreads;
From class-room tower and our babel to calm
Of inner sea unruffled by the slightest foam,
To open sea's roughcast and blue-white charm.

The heard and unseen arc of the shell strikes home
The Moses staff causing from the sea to sprout
A court-yard fountain, if heaven be the dome
Of blue upon the salt blue drought
Of desert ocean that needed this white rose,
This cluster white of bamboo shoots that out
Of blue rock at the strike of Moses grows
And pauses at the balance point that makes
The shape, that holds the pattern's close.

The bamboo plumes outward, white and takes
Its shape forever rooted in this sleeping sea
The hurrying motion of innumerable flakes
Of white and blue from ocean's rock I see
As motionless and full, unhurried calm,
As balanced as permanent as a perfect tree.

I look back at their faces' slight alarm
And wide-eyed wonder at my wandering-
These children's balanced being to be the palm
That bends to every wind's imposturing!
Each searching eye is a murky pool
Slowly lighted by shafts of quivering
Laughter. We turn the pages and make the best of school.

II.

<em>At Cette, from the cemetery where Paul Valery is buried</em>

I stand upon a Mediterranean slope
And look beyond white grave-stones to the tight
Stretching of green water, a silken rope
Played from the central deep to the edges white;
Aside in sandals I see the striding flesh
As through a yew tree breaks the light

Of lovers in their summer white above the mesh
Of grass and sand and clay that will sift them yet
To their dead brothers whom no winds refresh
For whom the rush and dash of waves beget
No dreams, no green urges yearning towards the sea.

The heard and unseen words of Valery set
Off the fountain from his tomb, and we
Become the balanced fountain; the hurrying
Constellations of our blood, the plea

Of every urge is caught; the scurrying
Is at the balance point; each fountain drop
Is held in place; our inner worrying
Moves no more and yet we grow, and stop
Caught in the crystal pattern's close
In the tree, in Valery's voiced fountain top,

In bamboo-shoots and sea's drought-quenching rose.

III.

<em>On his Grandmother's Death, news of which he received in Lans-en-Vercours</em>

Amidst this blue of skies and white of snows
I read the note from occidental hills
From where the slug-trailed custard-apple grows
And the bastard bombay mango daily fills
Its olive skin with juices that attain
The cycle's point of closure where fullness kills,
From where her trees so blindly know the gain
That sunlight brings, that soil provides, I hear
That she is dead.

Vibration of tolling bell again.
I feel, first felt with her at funeral
Of Bishop O'Hare, the sapling I beneath her shade
Not dreaming yet that time that made me tall
Would bend her to the earth and with its spade

Plough her ashes back to bless the soil
While her spirit's crystal fountain played
Above the roughcast ocean, above the toil
Of lovers young who stride on grass that covers
The bones and melted breasts where coil
Fingers and worms of their dead brothers.

The dead sea fountain sings to me with still
Persisting shape, Valery's perpetual motion hovers
In his voiced words shaping the silence on a hill
Above the central sea;

but you whose death
Disturbs these snows, scorching cold eyes that fill
The soul with wonder and with salt, even without breath
You live, not an impressed scent among yellow pages,
Not conjured back by any reader's breath,

But fountain of your being plays against the rages
Of time's raucous sea, the rose you were and are
And ever will be is your self still bursting through the
ages.
