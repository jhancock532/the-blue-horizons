# Dedication

To the Memory
of
WILLIAM ARTHUR RICHARDSON
and
JOHN GRENFELL WILLIAMS
one a Trinidadian
the other a South African

both because of conditions at home
working for long spells abroad
both (in the shared concern for
writing and broadcasting)
generous and helpful
to West Indian writers

both remembered gratefully and with affection,
through this book
many poems of which
would not have reached a wider audience
without their original concern and encouragement.

Peace to them, and Love.
